                                <p>A header enables the recruiters to know your basic contact details and where you are at present. A header should be clearly and neatly placed right on top of the resume – ideally centre aligned. You header should include:</p>
                                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Make sure your name is in bold and a bigger font than the rest of the resume.  <br>
                                <strong>E-mail ID:</strong> Do not share your work e-mail, but a personal one. However, make sure it sounds professional and unlike sweetguy@gmail.com or so.<br>
                                <strong>Phone and mobile number:</strong> It's best to list just one phone number. Make sure you add the code before a landline number. Only give a number on which you would be available during office hours.</p>

                                <p class="mt-30 subhead uppercase">OBJECTIVE</p>
                                <p><img src="{% static 'shinelearn/images/cms/rf-objective.jpg' %}" alt="OBJECTIVE" class="img-responsive" /></p>
                                <p>Convey your goal to your employer and aim towards a particular position in a specific industry in about 15 words. It should maximum go into 2 lines for middle to senior level candidates. It's important to customize the resume objective to match the position you are applying for. Customize your objective according to the job role you apply to. Keep in mind the employer’s requirement and be specific about your aim.</p>

                                <p class="mt-30 subhead uppercase">PROFILE SUMMARY</p>
                                <p><img src="{% static 'shinelearn/images/cms/rf-summary.jpg' %}" alt="PROFILE SUMMARY" class="img-responsive" /></p>
                                <p>A profile summary is the synopsis of your career. This section is your chance to convince the prospective employer that you have the skills necessary for the job, held responsible positions marked with achievements in the past, and that your career has progressed over the years.</p>
                                <p>For freshers, profile summary can be of 5 to 7 pointers. Explain your + points and skills in a clear and concise manner. Do not fake any achievements or projects.

                                <p class="mt-30 subhead uppercase">ACADEMIC PROJECTS</p>
                                <p><img src="{% static 'shinelearn/images/cms/rf-project.jpg' %}" alt="ACADEMIC PROJECTS" class="img-responsive" /></p>
                                <p>This section is considered to be an important section which determines your projects in detail. Since you are not experienced, it is essential for you to show the kind of work you can produce for upcoming organizations. Your examples will show you the capabilities in different areas. </p>
                                <p>Mention the projects individually and describe in short about your responsibilities over the period of time. Put all relevant information about the projects and present it in a clear and concise manner.</p>

                                <p class="mt-30 subhead uppercase">EDUCATION</p>
                                <p><img src="{% static 'shinelearn/images/cms/rf-education.jpg' %}" alt="EDUCATION" class="img-responsive" /></p>
                                <p>Your educational qualifications have a lot of effect on the recruiters’ decision to consider you for the job. The best approach in this case will be to list your qualifications in a functional manner, so that the recruiters see the most relevant ones on the top. This way, recruiters get the required information in just a glance. Mention your educational details starting from the most recent one.</p>
                                <p>Enlist life experiences like a short stint as a voluntary social worker, community service efforts as they are beneficial even if not related to the job. These can actually be translated to job skills. Listing coursework and awards also work to your advantage if they are relevant to the job you are applying for. Pay attention to areas where it fits the job's requirements. If you have any extra-curricular activities to boost your skills, mention them.</p>

                                <p class="mt-30 subhead uppercase">SKILLS</p>
                                <p><img src="{% static 'shinelearn/images/cms/rf-skills.jpg' %}" alt="SKILLS" class="img-responsive" /></p>
                                <p>Understand the requirement of the job vacancies you are interested in applying for. This exercise will help you outline the skill demands of those job openings and make it easier for you to list the most important skills you must highlight as you build your resume.</p>
                                <p class="mt-20">Use this section to:</p>

                                    <li>Outline your expertise</li>
                                    <li>Target your resume to a particular job opening by including keywords that define the particular job vacancy.</li>
                                    <li>Highlight soft skills</li>
                                    <li>Showcase transferable skills</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>For a fresher, it is essential to showcase extra curriculum activities. Listing your accomplishments in the resume not only showcases your candidature in a stronger light, it will also reinforce confidence in you about your career track. </p>

                                <p class="mt-30 subhead uppercase">PERSONAL DETAILS</p>
                                <p><img src="{% static 'shinelearn/images/cms/rf-details.jpg' %}" alt="PERSONAL DETAILS" class="img-responsive" /></p>
                                <p>There are no set rules for this section. Give the details you are comfortable with. For example, if you are worried about your age then you can skip this detail in the resume. Include details like:</p>
                                <ul class="rf-list">
                                    <li>Date of birth</li>

                                <p>In case of references, if you do not have any while submitting the resume then it is perfectly fine. Be ready, however, to face these questions at the time of interview.</p>

                                <p>A resume objective is like a headline to the rest of the resume. It lets the readers know what to expect from the resume. While some include the objective in the cover letter, many include it in the resume. For most of us, objectives feature in our resumes but no matter where we place it, <strong>an objective statement is important as it summarizes in a line what the resume is all about.</strong> It should contain the key words to get shortlisted among thousands of others.</p>

      <div class="acc_content">
        <p>The chronological resume format is one of the most traditional and recognisable formats. Recruiters prefer this format because of its familiar and simple layout.

Chronological resume format is the most popular structure which is used by many job seekers. They prefer this format because it encompasses all industries and experience levels. The only reason where you should not use this format is if you have multiple career gaps and frequency changed jobs. Choosing a chronological resume format for right reasons will surely impact your chances of standing out from other candidates.</p>

        <p>A functional resume format is known for a skill based resume which emphasises on qualifications, skills, and accomplishments.

Besides, it allows candidates from all backgrounds to portray their best foot forward. If you are using this resume format, remember to emphasize on your abilities and experience in a clear manner which will surely give you a best shot at interviews. </p>

<h2>Creative and visual resume formats</h2>

<p>When it comes to creative resumes, there are no specific formats. The resume itself is used as a work sample, depiction, or presentation of skills apart from the information provided. Young professionals in creative profiles have started the trend of using visual resumes, especially graphic designers and writers. On similar lines, developers have used HTML based resumes, animators and filmmakers have used video scripts, UI/UEx developers have used interactive flash files, and so on. Here are a few samples to take inspiration from.</p>
<ul class="formats">

It is important to understand that these resumes are not accepted everywhere and should be used with care. Also, they are difficult or impossible to run through application tracking software.

Simple text fonts in a maximum of two colors and three sizes are the basic requirements. Distributing information in shorter points, giving proper headings, aligning text on the left margin and other best practices make the resume look good and attractive. Composing simpler sentences, using appropriate vocabulary, highlighting or underlining important phrases, and similar practices with content will make it readable and legible.

Using odd fonts, uneven text alignment, long paragraphs (<4-5 sentences), long sentences (<22 words), etc are a strict no-no. Do not include your picture and other unnecessary information. Do not make your resume longer than two A4 size pages. But also, do not cramp the text in the document; leave ample spaces between lines, paragraphs, and other elements in the resume. </p>

<h2>Difference Between Resume, Curriculum Vitae (CV) and Biodata </h2>

<p>Resumes, CV and Biodata are very similar in nature and are used to present personal-professional information about a person. They are usually used in job applications, academic applications, and similar documentation. The primary differences between the three are: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Biodata is a very short document with basic factual information only while resume and CV present the same information in more details. Curriculum Vitaes contain very detailed information while resumes have brief descriptions only. </li>
        <li>Biodata formats are single page while resume formats can extend to two pages and CV formats can be even longer due to the details presented. However, it is not recommended to have a CV longer than 3-pages unless you are highly experienced. </li>
        <li>Biodata is used widely and may be required for documentation other than jobs or academic. Resumes and CVs are mainly used for job applications and academic applications or similar professional use. </li>
        <li>Biodata follows the format of a functional resume while CVs can be made with either combination resume or chronological resume. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-15">Once done, get it reviewed by someone experienced and others and make it even better.</p>
