    <strong>Why do you think this is the best profile?</strong>
    A profile which makes customer happy is considered as the best profile.

    <strong>What were the challenges faced while drafting this cv format?</strong>
    While developing this resume, I had to face a lot of challenges. The client did not like the resume in first go, he was not satisfied with the content and the layout. He rejected the resume a couple of times and even was irritated by the time of development call. But then I took it as a challenge and completed the resume and finally the client liked it.
